      <p class="disclaimer">
        We have designed a budgeting tool that will help with estimating their
        various household costs. Our hope is that you can use this information
        to help start your home buying experience, and after you enter your
        bedgeting information, you will be shown interest rates in the current
        market, alongside various homes for sale that fall within range. It
        should be noted that this site is used as a BASIC GUIDE and in no way
        should be used other than a basic starting estimation of what you can
        afford. Please consult with a licensed financial advisor, bank
        representative, or real estate agent for a true analysis of your
        financial situation.
