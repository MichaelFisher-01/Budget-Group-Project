        <p class="disclaimer">We have designed a budgeting tool that will help with estimating their various household costs. Our hope is that you can use this information to help start your home buying experience, and after you enter your bedgeting information, you will be shown interest rates in the current market, alongside various homes for sale that fall within range. It should be noted that this site is used as a BASIC GUIDE and in no way should be used other than a basic starting estimation of what you can afford. Please consult with a licensed financial advisor, bank representative, or real estate agent for a true analysis of your financial situation. </p>
